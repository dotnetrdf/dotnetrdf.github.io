From release 2.7.0 we now keep a static copy of the documentation for dotNetRDF on this site. This makes it easier
to find the documentation for a specific release and will make it easier for us to release documentation for
the upcoming releases without overwriting the documentation for the stable release.

Currently each minor release has its own sub-directory beneath here - there are no direct links between versions.

## Available Documentation

The documentation for the current stable version is always accessible [here](stable/index.html).
The current STABLE version is 3.1.x

The bleeding-edge documentation is always accessible [here](latest/index.html)
