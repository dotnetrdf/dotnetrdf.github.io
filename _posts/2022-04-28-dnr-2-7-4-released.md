We pushed a new update to dotNetRDF to NuGet today. This release just fixes a packaging error with the previous 2.7.3 release where the assembly files were missing correct FileVersion metadata.

[Change Log](https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf/blob/master/ChangeLog.txt).

dotNetRDF 2.7.4 can be found [here on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotNetRDF/2.7.4) and also on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf/releases/tag/v2.7.4).
