title: dotNetRDF 2.0.1 and 1.0.13  now available
tags: [dnr, releases]
---

We are pleased to announce two new dotNetRDF releases this month.

There is now a release version of dotNetRDF 2.0 (actually 2.0.1 as we made a quick bug-fix release to address some packaging issues),
and dotNetRDF 1.0.13 is now also a full release. 

2.0 adds support for .NET Core 1.1 and .NET Core 2.0, but removes support for .NET 3.5. The build process has been simplified and the repository
restructured to hopefully make it a bit easier for developers to work with the source code directly from GitHub. The other major addition in 2.0
is the provision of support for JSON-LD. For full details please refer to the [change log](https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf/blob/master/ChangeLog.txt)

Future development will be focussed on 2.0 so we recommend using this version if possible. The 1.0 branch will be retained to provide support for
.NET 3.5 and .NET 3.5 client profile but will not necessarily receive all back-ported bug-fixes unless volunteers provide PRs for this.
