title: VDS Common 1.7.0 Release
tags: [dnr, vds-common releases]
---

A new release of VDS.Common is now available on [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/VDS.Common/) and as a [binary package on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnetrdf/vds-common/releases).

VDS.Common is a library of datastructures and helper functions that are used in dotNetRDF, but which
are generic enough and useful enough to be packaged up as a separate library. It includes code for
sparse arrays, trees, tries as well as some useful extensions for .NET Enumeration types.

Like dotNetRDF, VDS.Common is licensed under the permissive [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

The library documentation is also now available on our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/dotnetrdf/vds-common/wiki)
