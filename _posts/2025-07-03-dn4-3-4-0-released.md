title: dotNetRDF 3.4.0 released
tags: [dnr, releases]
---

A minor version update of the dotNetRDF library is now available for download. 

This release makes several changes to the library to improve resource disposal and reduce memory leaks. These changes
should not affect library users but may require some changes to code which extends library classes.

This release also introduces a "safe mode" for JSON-LD processing. Setting this option to true will cause additional 
warnings to be raised when an invalid type, subject, predicate or object is encountered when parsing JSON-LD rather than
silently ignoring them.

Additional bug-fixes and minor changes are also noted in the change log.
