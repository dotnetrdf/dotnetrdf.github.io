A bugfix update of the dotNetRDF library is now available for download. 

This release fixes a couple of bugs in the RDFS reasoner.

  * Fix to handle graphs where there is a circular chain of rdfs:subPropertyOf or rdfs:subClassOf triples.
  * Fix to handle graphs where there is a resource with multiple rdfs:subPropertyOf or rdfs:subClassOf properties.
