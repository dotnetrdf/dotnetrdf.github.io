We are pleased to announce a new dotNetRDF release today.

The 2.5 release addresses a small number of bugs and adds some useful new functionality to the Stardog connector. For full details please refer to the [change log](https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf/blob/master/ChangeLog.txt).

dotNetRDF 2.5 can be found [here on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotNetRDF/2.5.0) and also on [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf/releases/tag/v2.5.0).

The dotNetRDF Toolkit has also been updated to use this new release of dotNetRDF. The only other change to this package is the removal of the old rdfWebDeploy application.

dotNetRDF Toolkit 2.0 can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotNetRDF.Toolkit/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
