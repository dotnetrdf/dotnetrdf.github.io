title: dotNetRDF 3.1.0 released
tags: [dnr, releases]
---

A minor version update of the dotNetRDF library is now available for download. 

This release fixes a couple of bugs reported in the Leviathan SPARQL query engine and in the utility code for detecting RDF collections that can be expressed in compact syntax. It also introduces some enhancements for language tag validation that changes the default mode to a lax, Turtle 1.1 compatible validation and makes the full BCP-47 well-formedness validation optional. The ConfigurationLoader has also been updated to support creating instances of the NodeFactory and UriFactory classes that were introduced in 3.0 as well as to support assigning a name to graphs created through the loader.

This release also adds some [important documentation on the way in which the dotNetRDF assemblies are signed](http://dotnetrdf.org/docs/3.1.x/user_guide/assembly_signing.html).
